          <p>
            1.1 These are the terms and conditions (the “<span>EULA</span>” or “
            <span>End User Licence Agreement</span>”) Hello Games Ltd (“
            <span>we</span>”, “<span>our</span>”, “<span>Hello</span>”) uses to

            Game as available on: PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4) and the services
            related to the Game. We’ve tried to keep these terms as short as
            possible to help you to understand how you can use the Game. If you
            do not want to or cannot agree to this EULA, you must not buy,
            download, install, use, play or otherwise access the Game. By

            1.2 We offer the Game through third party digital stores such as,
            without limitation, Steam, PlayStation and Xbox (each a “
            <span>Store</span>”). Where you purchase the Game through a Store
            you may need a Store account in order to play the Game, and your use
            of the Store and of the Game through the Store is subject to the
            terms of use and policies of the relevant Store (as may change from
            time to time).
          </p>
          <p>
            1.3 Where applicable, the Stores may allow you to get a refund in
            respect of or in connection with the Game in some instances. You
            should contact the Store directly that you purchased the Game from
            if you would like to request a refund.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.4 You must be at least 13 years old to play the Game. If you are

            the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must obtain the
            agreement and acceptance of a person with parental authority for you
            and that person agrees to and accepts this EULA.
