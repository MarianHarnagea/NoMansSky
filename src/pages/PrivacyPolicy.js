          <p>
            <span>To provide the Online Services to you</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            We will use information about you (including Basic Information,
            Registration Information, Analytics and User Content) for delivering
            our Games to you under the terms of use agreed between us. The
            processing of information in this way is necessary for us to record
            your progress and current status within a Game, and to ensure the
            Games deliver the features promised and function properly, so that
            you have the best experience when playing any one of our Games and
            using the Online Services.

            <span>To record discoveries in No Man’s Sky</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            On of the key elements of our Game No Man’s Sky is exploration. When
            exploring the No Man’s Sky environment, you may discover planets,
            alien bases, flora and fauna. If you are the first to do so, your
            discovery will be named after you, based on your No Man’s Sky
            username. Those names are viewable by other players.
          </p>

          <p>
            As this is a feature of No Man’s Sky, we process this information in
            order to deliver No Man’s Sky to you under the terms of use agreed
            between us.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you decide to stop playing No Man’s Sky, we will continue to use
            your username as the basis of the name of your discoveries. We do
            this in the pursuit of our legitimate interests.

            We may process information about you (including Basic Information,
            User Content, Registration Information, and Analytics) so that we

          </p>

          <p>
            This processing is also necessary for us to pursue our legitimate
            interests of (i) ensuring that our Online Services function properly
            so that you and other users have the best experience when playing
            any of our Game(s) and using the other Online Services; (ii)
            improving the quality of our Online Services and providing a better
            experience to our users; and (iii) identifying and correcting any
            bugs in the Games and Online Services.
